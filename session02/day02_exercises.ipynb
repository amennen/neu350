    "## Section 1: Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "As we talked about last time, python is a language of packages. Because base python is rather sparse, python users rely on a set of core packages (e.g. numpy, scipy, matplotlib) to accomplish most programming goals. The core packages are already installed with Anaconda. But what if we want to install a new package? Or update an existing package to a new verison?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cut to **pip**. pip is a package manager for python. In other words, it's a tool that allows you to install and manage python libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library. Briefly, pip works by querying the [Pyton Package Index](https://pypi.org/), an online repostory of python packages and their versions. In the following section, we'll cover the basics of using pip (installing, updating, and uninstalling packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Open a terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "pip is a command line tool. That is, it's a tool that can be called and used from a Terminal session. There are many ways to open a Terminal (e.g. go to Applications --> Terminal, launch a new Terminal from jupyter-lab, or launch a Terminal from Anaconda Navigator).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Make sure pip is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "pip comes standard with Anaconda, meaning it should already be available on your machine. To make sure, enter the following command in the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Show list of installed packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the list of packages already available, type enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Install a new package\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's tutorial, we will be making use of two new packages, `neo` and `mne`. The command for installing these packages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install neo mne\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the syntax for installing a new package is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Updating a package\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's tutorial, we will be making use of another package, `seaborn`. The command for updating this packge is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the syntax for updating a new package is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Uninstalling a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, uninstalling a package is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7 (Optional): Clearing space\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodically, you may want to remove optional files from your installs (e.g. zip files). To do so, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda clean --all\n",
